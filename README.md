# Hello-World
My first repository - expect it to be general, for ideas, resources, and discussions.

A bit about me: My name is Rhiannon, after Fleetwood Mac's song. I lift weights to balance out my coffee and gaming habits. Quite fond of science fiction novels. I'm trained in Economics, Philosophy and Statistics, with a Post Grad in Project Management. Looking to better my experience in Statistics and Data Science.
